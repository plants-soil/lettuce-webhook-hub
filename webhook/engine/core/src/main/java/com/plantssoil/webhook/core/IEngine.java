 * Publisher could trigger events, subscribers could receive the events if they
 * subscribed the events<br/>
 * Could use IEngineFactory to get webhook engine instance: e.g:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 *   IEngineFactory factory = IEngineFactory.getFactoryInstance();
 *   IEngine engine = factory.getEngine();
 *   ...
 * </code>
